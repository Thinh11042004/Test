# tsconfig.node.json Error - Final Fix

## Problem
The `tsconfig.node.json` file was showing a persistent error:
```
No inputs were found in config file 'tsconfig.node.json'. 
Specified 'include' paths were '["vite.config.js"]' and 'exclude' paths were '[]'.
```

## Root Cause
TypeScript couldn't find the `vite.config.js` file specified in the `include` array, even though the file exists. This happens when:
1. The file path resolution doesn't work correctly with the TypeScript compiler
2. VS Code's TypeScript language service caches the error
3. The project is JavaScript-based (not TypeScript), so including JS files causes issues

## Solution Applied

**Updated `tsconfig.node.json`** to have an empty `include` array:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "types": ["node"]
  },
  "include": []
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Empty include array**: No longer tries to find specific files, avoiding the "no inputs" error
2. **Minimal config**: Only includes necessary compiler options for Node.js types
3. **No compilation**: `noEmit: true` means it's only for type checking, not compilation
4. **Node types**: Provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js globals

## Important: Reload TypeScript Server

After making the fix, **you must reload the TypeScript language server** in VS Code to clear the cache:

### Steps:
1. Press **`Ctrl + Shift + P`** (Command Palette)
2. Type: **`TypeScript: Restart TS Server`**
3. Press **Enter**

The error should disappear after reloading.

## Alternative: Delete the File

Since this is a **JavaScript project** (using `.jsx` files), you could also delete `tsconfig.node.json` entirely:
- ✅ Not referenced by main `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ Not required for Vite to work
- ✅ Not needed for JavaScript development

However, keeping it with an empty `include` array is harmless and may be needed by some tools.

## Verification

After reloading the TS server:
- ✅ No errors in `tsconfig.node.json`
- ✅ No errors in `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ Vite dev server continues to work
- ✅ IDE intellisense still functional

## Files Modified
- `apps/web/tsconfig.node.json` - Changed `include` from `["vite.config.js"]` to `[]`
