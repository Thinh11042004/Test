# TypeScript Configuration Fix

## Issue
`tsconfig.node.json` was showing an error:
```
No inputs were found in config file. Specified 'include' paths were '["vite.config.js"]' 
and 'exclude' paths were '[]'.
```

## Root Cause
The project is using **JavaScript** (`.jsx` files) for React components, not TypeScript (`.tsx`). However, there was a `tsconfig.node.json` file configured with:
- `composite: true` - which requires TypeScript input files
- `include: ["vite.config.js"]` - trying to include a JavaScript file

TypeScript project references (`composite: true`) don't work well when all the files are JavaScript.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Project Reference
**File**: `apps/web/tsconfig.json`
- Removed the reference to `tsconfig.node.json` since it's not needed for a JavaScript project
- The main tsconfig.json is only needed for type checking and IDE support

**Before**:
```json
{
  "include": ["src"],
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### 2. Deleted tsconfig.node.json
Since this is a pure JavaScript project (not TypeScript), the `tsconfig.node.json` file is not necessary. The file was deleted.

## Why This Works

1. **JavaScript Project**: The codebase uses `.jsx` files, not `.ts` or `.tsx` files
2. **TypeScript for IDE Only**: The `tsconfig.json` is only used for:
   - IDE intellisense and type hints
   - Type checking of JSDoc comments
   - Allowing `allowJs: true` for better editor support
3. **Vite Doesn't Need It**: Vite works perfectly with JavaScript without TypeScript configuration files
4. **No Build Impact**: Removing tsconfig.node.json doesn't affect the build process

## Current Configuration

**Main TypeScript Config** (`apps/web/tsconfig.json`):
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "allowJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "types": ["vite/client"],
    ...
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

This configuration:
- ✅ Provides type hints for JavaScript files
- ✅ Supports React JSX syntax
- ✅ Includes Vite client types
- ✅ Doesn't try to compile anything (`noEmit: true`)
- ✅ No errors or warnings

## Verification

1. ✅ No TypeScript errors in tsconfig.json
2. ✅ Web container running successfully
3. ✅ Vite dev server working: http://localhost:3000
4. ✅ Hot reload functioning properly
5. ✅ IDE support for JSX files maintained

## Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

If you wanted to keep tsconfig.node.json, you would need to:
1. Convert `vite.config.js` to `vite.config.ts`
2. Convert all config files to TypeScript
3. Add proper TypeScript dependencies

But since this is a JavaScript project, removing the file is the cleanest solution.
