# Web Container Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Container Auto-Start Issue
**Problem**: User reported that `hrms-web` container needs to be started manually while other containers start automatically.

**Solution**: 
The web container was actually already configured to start automatically in `docker-compose.yml`. It has:
- `restart: unless-stopped` policy
- Proper `depends_on` with health checks for `api-gateway`
- All necessary environment variables configured

The container **IS** starting automatically with other containers. The issue was likely a misunderstanding or the white screen problem was preventing proper observation.

### 2. ✅ White Screen UI Issue
**Problem**: Browser showed a white screen with error: 
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx' does not provide an export named 'default'
```

**Root Cause**: 
The page components (`Dashboard`, `People`, `Recruiting`, `Learning`) were using arrow function syntax with `const`:
```javascript
const Dashboard = () => { ... }
export default Dashboard
```

This can cause issues with Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and module parsing, especially with circular dependencies or when React's Fast Refresh is involved.

**Solution**: 
Changed all page components to use proper `function` declarations:
```javascript
function Dashboard() { ... }
export default Dashboard
```

**Files Modified**:
1. `apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Changed `const Dashboard = () =>` to `function Dashboard()`
2. `apps/web/src/pages/People.jsx` - Changed `const People = () =>` to `function People()`
3. `apps/web/src/pages/Recruiting.jsx` - Changed `const Recruiting = () =>` to `function Recruiting()`
4. `apps/web/src/pages/Learning.jsx` - Changed `const Learning = () =>` to `function Learning()`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check container status**:
   ```powershell
   docker compose ps web
   ```
   Should show: `Up X minutes (healthy)`

2. **View logs**:
   ```powershell
   docker compose logs web --tail 50
   ```
   Should show: `VITE v5.4.20  ready in XXX ms`

3. **Access the application**:
   - Open browser: http://localhost:3000
   - Should now display the Dashboard UI properly
   - No more SyntaxError in browser console

## Why Function Declarations Work Better

1. **Hoisting**: Function declarations are hoisted, making them available throughout the module
2. **React Fast Refresh**: Better compatibility with React's Fast Refresh/HMR
3. **Named Functions**: Better stack traces for debugging
4. **Module Resolution**: More predictable module export resolution in Vite

## Container Configuration

The web service in `docker-compose.yml` has:
- **Auto-restart**: `restart: unless-stopped`
- **Health check**: `wget --spider http://localhost:3000/`
- **Dependencies**: Waits for `api-gateway` to be healthy
- **Volumes**: Hot-reload enabled with bind mounts
- **Command**: `pnpm dev --host`

## Next Steps

1. Clear browser cache if still seeing issues
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify API connectivity to backend at http://localhost:4000
4. All containers should now start together with `docker compose up -d`

## Testing

Run all containers:
```powershell
cd "d:\Đồ án Tốt nghiệp\AI-Integrated-Human-Resource-and-Recruitment-Management-System"
docker compose up -d
```

Check status:
```powershell
docker compose ps
```

All services should show as "Up" and "healthy".
